"2.15.2":`
## Fixed:
- Pressing enter on a text element erroneously activated all markdown embeddables in the scene. [discord](https://discord.com/channels/1026825302900494357/1412683408424833045)

## Fixed in ExcalidrawAutomate
- \`getActiveEmbeddableViewOrEditor (view?:ExcalidrawView): {view:any}|{file:TFile, editor:Editor}|{node: ObsidianCanvasNode}|null;\` no returns the node, instead of the empty view from the leaf.
`,
"2.15.1":`
## Fixed
- PDF improvements
  - It was not possible to scroll the embedded PDF. [#9891](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9891)
  - Embedded PDF pages were blurred (pixelated).
  - Embedded PDF now accurately follows \`excalidraw-embeddable-theme\` document property.
    - auto: follows Excalidraw theme (regardless of Obsidian theme)
    - default: follows Obsidian theme (regardless of Excalidraw theme)
    - dark: always displays the PDF in dark mode (regardless of Excalidraw and Obsidian themes)
    - light: always displays the PDF in light mode (regardless of Excalidraw and Obsidian themes)
  - New embeddable-menu buttons:
    - Snapshot: inserts an image of the current active page to the scene
    - Bookmark: updates the embed link to the current page
- Pasting an oversized image triggered an error and caused Excalidraw to discard the scene. [#2453](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2453), [#9878](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/9878)
- Video with local URI will no longer autoplay when the scene loads
- Error creating link to element when element is a sticky note
- Area link embeds hide the content of the objects within the area [#2461](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2461)
- On Obsidian Mobile 1.9.10, embeddables could cause a black/white screen (no active view) until reselecting the Excalidraw page; [#2460](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2460)
- Scrolling of embedded web pages on mobile devices is working again.

## New
- Insert Any File now supports adding Audio files.
- New option in settings under "Zoom and Pan". Pan with right mouse button (Miro-style): right-click and drag to pan the canvas. Press 'm' for the context menu (disabled while editing text). üôè [@mfuria](https://github.com/mfuria) for making this happen! [#2450](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/pull/2450), [#329](https://github.com/zsviczian/excalidraw/pull/329)

## Deprecated
- Removed "Toggle RAW mode" from the Command Palette and the Obsidian Tools menu due to low usage. RAW mode remains available by adding \`excalidraw-plugin: raw\` to the note's YAML frontmatter/document properties.

## New
- Introducing **Marker Frames**. These are special frames that can be used to mark slides, pages areas for PDF printouts, image references, etc.
  To create a marker frame, create a frame and toggle the marker frame in the elements properties panel.
    - Markers are not included in exports such as images or PDFs.
    - Markers do not contain elements
    - Markers can be hidden/shown from the canvas context menu
- Updated the "Printable Layout Wizard" script
  - Now works with marker frames
  - Supports different page sizes and orientations within a single PDF document
  - The printout may include non-marker frames (e.g., PDF image embeds in frames)
- Pro-tip: You can also use marker frames... 
    - with the Slideshow plugin
    - to create image-area references such that the frames do not get rendered in exported images, and you can reference areas by frame name
- Performance improvement of Image-area references

# New in ExcalidrawAutomate
- \`createPDF()\` now supports \`SVG[]\` array of SVGs with different sizes.
- New function:
\`\`\`ts

Updated the Printable Layout Wizard script with the option to exclude empty pages.

## Fixed
- If a frame is locked, elements created over the frame or dragged over the frame should not be auto-added to the frame. [#9850](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/9850)

## Fixed in ExcalidrawAutomate
- Not all AppState properties were being correctly copied to the template when creating a new drawing with ea.create() [#2440](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2440)
`,
"2.14.2":`
## Fixed
- Converting Markdown to Excalidraw ("Back of note"/"Convert markdown to ExcaliDrawing") no longer appends T00:00:00.000Z to an existing date frontmatter field and handles merging of lists such as tags intelligently [#2414](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2414)
- Multi‚Äëpoint line creation on touchscreens (tap‚Äìtap‚Äìtap) produced a horizontal line after using a pen. Fixed. [#9840](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9840#issuecomment-3165319266)

## New
- Zoom settings (Settings ‚Üí Excalidraw ‚Üí Appearance and Behavior ‚Üí Zoom) [#2434](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2434):
  - Zoom increment (default 5%) to fine‚Äëtune mouse wheel / gesture precision.
  - Minimum zoom (default 10%) controls how far you can zoom out (below 10% may be unstable‚Äîuse with caution).
  - Maximum zoom (default 3000%) defines the upper zoom limit.
- Palm Guard script (in script store): Mobile-friendly drawing mode for stylus users. Enters fullscreen, hides UI, shows a draggable minimal toolbar (toggle + exit) to prevent accidental palm taps; single tap to exit. Inspired by [#2409](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2409)

## ExcalidrawAutomate
- Improved \`FloatingModal\` behavior. Floating Modal now does not trap keyboard events, the header element does not block "X" button in the top right corner, all four corners are rounded on Mobile Devices.

`,
"2.14.1":`
## Fixed
- Excalidraw broke Obsidian's UI in Arabic, Persian, and Hebrew due to LTR, RTL conflict. [#2423](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2423) 
- Styling issues impacting native Obsidian search/replace dialogs. [#2420](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2420)
- Now using native Obsidian attachment location function. üôè [mnaoumov](https://github.com/mnaoumov) [#2421](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/pull/2421), potentially fixes [#179](https://github.com/RainCat1998/obsidian-custom-attachment-location/issues/179) of the Obsidian Custom Attachment Location plugin issue.

## New
- New frontmatter option \`excalidraw-embed-md\`. When set to \`true\`, embedding the drawing into a markdown note will render the "back of the note" (its markdown content) instead of rendering it as an image.
  - If you want to always display the drawing as an image, even when \`excalidraw-embed-md\` is enabled, use the special embed syntax: \`![[drawing#^as-image]]\`. Here, \`as-image\` is a phantom block reference that forces image rendering.
- Added Spanish translation by [@Joakim31](https://github.com/Joakim31) [#2425](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/pull/2425)
- Incremental minor updates from the main [Excalidraw project](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw).
`,
"2.14.0":`
## A Big "Small" Update
- Added search to Excalidraw Settings, plus added a link to access the public NotebookLM workbook pre-loaded with everything about the plugin
- New Taiwan-idiomatic Traditional Chinese translation by [@rlan](https://github.com/rlan) [#2413](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/pull/2413)
`,
"2.13.2":`
## New
- Excalidraw now properly supports drag and drop of obsidian links from Bases.
- ExcalidrawAutomate exposes a new class: \`FloatingModal\`. This is a modified version of the Obsidian.Modal class that allows the modal to be dragged around the screen and that does not dim the background. You can use it to create custom dialogs that behave like Obsidian modals but with more flexibility.
`,
"2.13.1":`
## New
- Support for Obsidian bases as embeddables in Excalidraw.
  - **Note:** The feature is only available to Insiders who have Obsidian 1.9.4 or later installed.
  - If your base includes multiple views you can pin the desired view similar to filtering to a section (click top left # button; \`[[my.base|my view]]\`).

## Fixed
- Cannot type in embedded web forms. In certain cases, typing within these embeds would trigger Excalidraw hotkeys instead of interacting with the embedded content. [#2403](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2403)

</div></div>

## New
- **Flexible Auto-Export Location:** Take control of where your auto-exported .png, .svg, and .excalidraw files are saved. Addressing a long-standing request, you can now define custom output paths using the new **Excalidraw Hooks**.
  - Implement the \`onImageExportPathHook\` callback in your ExcalidrawAutomate startup script to control the *destination path*.
    - Get the skeleton script via plugin settings or download it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/refs/heads/master/src/constants/assets/startupScript.md).

- **Control Auto-Export Trigger:** Use the \`onTriggerAutoexportHook\` in your startup script to decide *if* and *how* auto-export runs for a file, based on its properties or frontmatter, *before* the export path is determined.

- **Improved "Open Excalidraw drawing":** The Command Palette command now searches the *entire Vault* for the matching Excalidraw file when used on an embedded .svg or .png, useful when exports are in different folders.

- **Placeholder Files for New Embeds:** When embedding a new drawing as PNG/SVG via the Command Palette, empty placeholder files are now created immediately based on your auto-export setting. This ensures Obsidian correctly updates links if you rename the file soon after creation (when "Keep filenames in sync" is on).

- **Paste Obsidian URLs into Excalidraw:** Pasting an Obsidian URL for an image or file into Excalidraw now inserts the associated image directly into the drawing.

- **\`onImageFilePathHook\` Drag & Drop Support:** The \`onImageFilePathHook\` (for controlling location/filename of *embedded* files) is now triggered when dragging and dropping files into Excalidraw from outside Obsidian, matching the existing behavior for pasting.

## Fixed

- Dynamic styling was not working when frames were present in the scene.
- Minor fix to the screenshot feature. This also resolves the long-standing issue where window control buttons (close, minimize, maximize) appeared in full-screen mode.
- Fixed an issue where ALT/OPT + dragging an embeddable object sometimes failed, resulting in an empty object instead of dragging the element.

## New

- **Line Polygons**: Draw a closed line shape, and it will automatically snap into a polygon. [#9477](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9477)
  - Updated the Split Ellipse and Boolean Operations scripts to support this feature.
  - When entering line editor mode (CTRL/CMD + click), the lock point is now marked for easier editing. You can break the polygon using the polygon action in the elements panel.
- **Popout Override**: The "Open the back-of-the-note for the selected image in a popout window" action now overrides the "Focus on Existing Tab" setting and always opens a new popout.
- **Text Arch Enhancements**: The Text Arch script now supports fitting text to a wider range of paths and shapes. Text can also be edited and refitted to different paths.
- **Improved Unlock UI**: Single-clicking a locked element now shows an unlock button. [#9546](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9546)
- **Script Update Alerts**: On startup, Excalidraw will notify you if any installed scripts have available updates.

## New
- New "Screenshot" option in the Export Image dialog. This allows you to take a screenshot of the current view, including embedded web pages, youtube videos, and markdown documents. Screenshot is only possible in PNG.
- Expose parameter in plugin settings to disable AI functionality [#2325](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2325)
- Enable (disable) double-click text editing option in Excalidraw appearance and behavior (based on request on Discord)
- Added two new PDF export sizes: "Match image", "HD Screen".
- Switch between basic shapes. Quickly change the shape of the selected element by pressing TAB [#9270](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9270)
- Updated the Scribble Helper Script. Now controls are at the top so your palm does accidently trigger them. I added a new button to insert special characters. Scribble helper now makes use of the new text element wrapping in Excalidraw.

## Fixed in the plugin
- Scaling multiple embeddables at once did not work. [#2276](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2276)
- When creating multiple back-of-the-note the second card is not created correctly if autosave has not yet happened.
- Drawing reloads while editing the back-of-the-note card in certain cases causes editing to be interrupted.
- Moved Excalidraw filetype indicator ‚úèÔ∏è to after filename where other filetype tags are displayed. You can turn the filetype indicator on/off in plugin settings under Miscellaneous.

## Fixed by Excalidraw.com
- Alt-duplicate now preserves the original element. Previously, using Alt to duplicate would swap the original with the new element, leading to unexpected behavior and several downstream issues. [#9403](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9403)
- When dragging the arrow endpoint, update the binding only on the dragged side [#9367](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9367)
- Laser pointer trail disappearing on pointerup [#9413](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9413) [#9427](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9427)

This allows you to create alternative grid styles, such as horizontal-only lined grids instead of the traditional checkered pattern.

## Fixed in ExcalidrawAutomate

## New in ExcalidrawAutomate
- New hook: ${String.fromCharCode(96)}onImageFileNameHook${String.fromCharCode(96)}. When set, this callback is triggered when a image is being saved in Excalidraw.
- PDF export functions, paving the way for slideshow to export slides to PDF

 * with the excalidraw generated name and default path.
